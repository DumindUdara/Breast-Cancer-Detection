# Breast Cancer Detection

### About

The **Breast Cancer Detection** project utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify tumors as either malignant or benign using the he below mention data set from kaggle. This project aims to assist in early cancer detection by analyzing tumor characteristics.

The code is built using Python libraries, including **pandas** and **NumPy** for data handling, **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for visualization, and **scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms. The main algorithms applied in this project are **Logistic Regression**, **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**, **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Random Forest**, and **K-Means Clustering**. These models help evaluate the datasetâ€™s features, aiming to accurately predict the tumor status.

## Dataset

### Dataset Name
**Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set**

### Dataset Details
The **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set** is a well-known dataset used for the classification of breast cancer tumors. It consists of 569 instances, each representing a different patient, with 30 features that describe various attributes of the tumors. The dataset is divided into two classes:

- **Malignant (1)**: Tumors that are cancerous.
- **Benign (0)**: Tumors that are non-cancerous.

#### Features
The features in the dataset include various measurements computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. They describe characteristics such as:

- **Radius**: Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.
- **Texture**: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
- **Perimeter**: Mean size of the cancer tumor.
- **Area**: Mean area of the tumor.
- **Smoothness**: Mean of local variations in radius lengths.
- **Compactness**: Mean of (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0).
- **Concavity**: Mean of the severity of concave portions of the contour.
- **Concave Points**: Mean number of concave portions of the contour.
- **Symmetry**: Mean of symmetry values.
- **Fractal Dimension**: Mean of the coastline length of the tumor.

This dataset serves as a benchmark for machine learning algorithms and is widely used for testing classification techniques in medical diagnosis.
